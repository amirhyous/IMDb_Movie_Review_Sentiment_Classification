# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Classification

This project focuses on classifying IMDb movie review comments using both traditional machine learning techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset provided contains user reviews from IMDb and includes both labeled and unlabeled data. The goal is to train models to classify the sentiment of these reviews, either as positive or negative, and to experiment with different data augmentation and label propagation methods.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a sentiment classification model using semi-supervised learning techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs). The project involved:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset and extracting key insights from the user reviews.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting features from the text data for model training. The dataset already includes embeddings, making the NLP tasks more manageable.
3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Using label propagation techniques (such as KMeans) to label a portion of the unlabeled data and combine it with the manually labeled data.
4. **Using Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Utilizing pre-trained LLMs like those from Hugging Face (Phi-3) for label generation and training models.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following segments:
- **Training dataset**: Labeled IMDb movie reviews used to train models.
- **Test dataset**: Used to validate the models' performance.
- **Augmentation dataset**: Unlabeled data used for semi-supervised learning and label propagation.

## Tasks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform an initial analysis of the reviews to understand patterns and features that can aid in sentiment classification.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Extract and use the pre-existing embeddings in the dataset for sentiment analysis.
   - Research other feature extraction techniques for text data.

3. **Label Propagation**:
   - Implement traditional semi-supervised learning methods such as KMeans to label the unlabeled data.
   - Train models using both manually labeled and auto-labeled data.

4. **Large Language Models**:
   - Fine-tune and implement LLMs for label generation using the Hugging Face `Transformers` library.
   - Compare the performance of models trained with labels generated by LLMs versus those trained using traditional methods.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Both the traditional and LLM-based models are compared based on these metrics.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (For LLMs and pre-trained models)
- **scikit-learn** (For traditional machine learning models)
- **Google Colab** (For running notebooks and leveraging free GPU resources)

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

You can also run the notebooks directly on **Google Colab**.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirhyous/IMDb_Movie_Review_Sentiment_Classification.git
   cd IMDb_Movie_Review_Sentiment_Classification
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore EDA, feature engineering, and model training:
   - `review_classification.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

3. Ensure the dataset files are loaded correctly as per the instructions in the notebook.

4. Train the models and evaluate their performance using the test dataset.

## Results

After training, the models are evaluated on the test set. The project compares the results from:
- Traditional methods with label propagation.
- LLM-based methods for generating labels.
